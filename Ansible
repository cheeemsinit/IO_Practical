Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment, intra service orchestration, cloud provisioning and many other IT tools.
Ansible is easy to deploy because it does not use any agents or custom security infrastructure. Ansible works by connecting your nodes through ssh(by default).
But if you want other method for connection like Kerberos, Ansible gives that option to you.
Ansible uses playbook to describe automation jobs, and playbook uses very simple language i.e. YAML
It’s a human-readable data serialization language & is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored.
After connecting to your nodes, Ansible pushes small programs called as “Ansible Modules”.
Ansible runs that modules on your nodes and removes them when finished.
Ansible manages your inventory in simple text files (These are the hosts file).


How Ansible Works?


Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them.
Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH(Linux) windows(winrm)), and removes them when finished.
Your library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no servers, daemons, or databases required.
The management node in the above picture is the controlling node (managing node) which controls the entire execution of the playbook.
It’s the node from which you are running the installation. 
The inventory file provides the list of hosts where the Ansible modules needs to be run and the management node does a SSH connection and executes the small modules on the hosts machine and installs the product/software


Beauty of Ansible is that it removes the modules once those are installed so effectively it connects to host machine , executes the instructions and if it’s successfully installed removes the code which was copied on the host machine which was executed.
